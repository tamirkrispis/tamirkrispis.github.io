            <h3>Boost your productivity!</h3>
            <p>
                Keepaste is a cross-platform application that simplifies the process of storing and pasting frequently used commands and text phrases.
                <br>No more time-consuming searches for that command syntax you used recently or that DB query you keep on forgetting or repeatedly retyping the same commands over and over again on your day-to-day work.
                <br>With Keepaste, you can save time and effort by quickly accessing your stored text and pasting it on any other window with a single click. It's designed to be intuitive and efficient.
                <br>Main use case - keeping command lines and their arguments and executing those on a terminal, IDE on any other window upon need.

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Easy text phrases / commands storage</b>
                    <br>Store an unlimited number of text phrases (we call them 'Keeps') in Keepaste's user-friendly interface. Organize your phrases into categories for easy management and retrieval.</li>
                <li><b>Automated Paste on Target Windows</b>
                <br>Will automatically switch to a desired window, paste your Keep (text phrase) and press the 'Enter' key with a click of a button. Whether you're coding, analysing data, writing emails, or chatting with friends, Keepaste ensures you never have to retype the same content repeatedly.</li>
                <li><b>Dynamic Parameters</b>
                <br>Instead of multiple Keeps (phrases/commands) for different situations, you can have a single generic Keep which holds one or more dynamically set parameters. An extremely powerful feature!</li>
                <li><b>Import / Export</b>
                <br>Expand, Share and Backup your Keeps by using an easy export/import features.</li>
